/**
 * HTML-FINISH · PROFILE — the arrangement guards, one per shipped row.
 *
 * ⚠ THESE ASSERT ON `innerHTML` / element ORDER, NEVER ON `textContent`
 * (CLAUDE.md §8 O-7). Every row here is a COMPOSITION delta — which element
 * wraps which, and in what order — and `textContent` flattens exactly the
 * markup that carries the meaning. A `textContent` assertion on row 15 or
 * row 19 passes on the pre-change build it was written to reject.
 *
 * ⚠ NO VALUE IS ASSERTED. These guards pin topology (`auto-rows-fr`, sibling
 * order, nesting) and never a colour, radius, px or type size — the mockups
 * are light-mode prototypes (DESIGN.B1) and the shipped system owns the
 * values, so a guard that pinned one would pin the wrong thing.
 *
 * Fixtures are INLINE plain objects on the shipped `src/server/profile/*` DTOs
 * (type-only imports — no server code executes; NO DB), matching the posture of
 * `surface.test.tsx`. No market content is invented (CLAUDE.md §3).
